# CO₂ Emissions Analysis – Global Trends and Insights

Project Overview

This project explores global CO₂ emissions data from 1900 to 2025 using Python. The goal was to understand long-term emission trends, analyze differences between energy sources, and highlight the contribution of the largest emitting countries. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and deriving insights that support environmental decision-making.

Objectives

Analyze historical global CO₂ emissions over time

Break down emissions by source (coal, oil, gas)

Identify the top 10 emitting countries and how their contributions evolved

Create clear and meaningful visualizations of key trends

Derive insights that can inform climate strategies and sustainability policies

Tech Stack

Languages and Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Data

The datasets include annual CO₂ emissions by country and by source. They are based on publicly available historical data (e.g. Our World in Data).

co2_total.csv – total annual CO₂ emissions

co2_coal.csv – emissions from coal

co2_oil.csv – emissions from oil

co2_gas.csv – emissions from gas

Key Results

Global CO₂ emissions have increased more than twentyfold since 1900.

Fossil fuels remain the dominant sources, though their relative shares have shifted.

The ten largest emitters account for more than 70% of global emissions.

Emerging economies have become significant contributors in the last three decades.

Visualizations

The analysis includes several visual components, such as:

Total global CO₂ emissions over time

Comparison of emissions by energy source

Share of global emissions by the top 10 countries

Evolution of emissions for key individual countries

Learnings

This project improved my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. It also taught me how to turn raw datasets into meaningful insights and communicate them through clear visual storytelling.

Future Work

Extend the analysis with per-capita and sector-level emissions

Explore correlations with GDP and population data

Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
